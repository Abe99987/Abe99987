## 📈 Now Trading / Now Building

I trade global markets and build rails for them at the same time.

* Trading: crypto, precious metals, select equities and indices

* Building: a tokenized-commodities exchange for real people, not just funds

* Goal: asset-backed rails where retail, producers, and institutions can all clear on the same stack

> now

> markets: crypto · commodities · equities

> building: PBCEx · Timeline (S.E.P.T.) · automation lab

> location: Pittsburgh, PA

> mode: shipping, not polishing

Right now I’m focused on:

* Shipping the PBCEx MVP (synthetic metals on an internal trading ledger)

* Price aggregation, hedging, and dashboards for metals and FX flows

* Agent-driven ops: ledgers, support drafts, monitoring, and journaling

## 🏦 PBCEx – People’s Bank & Commodities Exchange

PBCEx lets users buy, hold, trade, and eventually redeem physical commodities.

* Early phase: synthetic metals (XAU-s, XAG-s, XPT-s, XPD-s, XCU-s) on an internal ledger

* Custody partners and vault-backed metals rather than pure paper exposure

* Physical fulfillment via metals wholesalers and insured logistics

* Spread + fee model targeting a lean, transparent market-of-record for metals

* Long-term plan: vault-backed tokens and a dedicated settlement stack (L1 + L2s)

Core public repos:

* [`abes-pbcex-workspace`](https://github.com/Abe99987/abes-pbcex-workspace) – monorepo for backend, frontend, and ops tooling

* `PBCEx-Obsidian` – knowledge base, specs, and architecture decision records (ADRs)

* Admin and ops terminals for risk, hedging, support, and investor tiles

## 🧾 Evidence-First History – Timeline & S.E.P.T.

I care about how we record events as much as how we trade them.

S.E.P.T. stands for: Source, Event, Place, Time.

Source S said that event E occurred at place P during time T.

The idea:

* Every entry has who, what, when, where, and why

* Evidence attached: people, places, things, photos, notes, papers, journals

* A chain of evidence: who wrote this, when, and who handled and submitted it?

* Meta tags:

  * People – e.g., “Martin Luther King Jr.”, “George Washington”

  * Places – e.g., “Shanghai, China”

  * Things – e.g., “AI”, “F-22 jet plane”

  * Lens – e.g., “Religion”, “Finance”, “Research”, “News”

We are usually reading the victor’s version of history. S.E.P.T. focuses on:

* Storyline = why and how, not just what

* Backlinks between correlated events

* Higher correlation and stronger evidence → higher probability and correlation scores

Repo:

* [`Timeline`](https://github.com/Abe99987/Timeline) – evidence-based historical timeline with S.E.P.T. indexing

## 🧪 Other Builds

Outside of PBCEx, I build tools where real-world operators need live data.

* Meat export & slaughterhouse dashboard – live beef prices and export data for a slaughterhouse builder/exporter, wired into a charting interface so they can track spreads and opportunities.

* Internal tools and experiments:

  * Micro-manufacturing and metals workflows

  * Ops dashboards for logistics and payments

  * Utilities around trading, journaling, and research

Most of these use the same core stack: Next.js, TypeScript, and AI-assisted workflows.

## 🤖 AI Development Stack

I run an AI-centered workflow anchored by a “second brain” system.

Context layer:

* Obsidian vault and GitHub repos (front-matter + tags) mirrored into a Pinecone index

* Unified context across AI tools via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and model-context-protocol-style patterns

Workflow loop:

1. Plan and prompt engineering with GPT-class models using template/meta prompts

2. Build and test with Claude models

3. Use CodeRabbit / CodeX for pull-request gating and code review

4. Close each session with an ADR (architecture decision record) and session journal, then upsert to Pinecone

Quality control:

* Manual reviews after builds and again after test runs

* Final pass after PR reviews to avoid regressions and hallucinations

* Clear audit trail and fast iteration cycles

Terminal setup:

* iTerm2 + tmux running parallel command-line agents (Claude, Gemini, Grok, internal scripts)

* Repos wired for multi-agent workflows

Agents and use cases:

* Price aggregation agent – aggregates prices from several online sources to build a live range

* Customer-support drafting agent – drafts responses for support emails to a drafts folder for human review and send

* Markets agent – generates daily price charts and stats for hidden markets dashboards

Post-funding plan: hybrid architecture

* Local models (NAS-backed) for sensitive data

* Cloud models for general reasoning

* Open WebUI / open-source stacks as hybrid interfaces

* Running Qwen, LLaMA, and GPT-class models locally for experiments and “agent builder” projects
